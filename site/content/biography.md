David Majury Wightman (1963-2019) was born in Newtownards, Northern Ireland. He led a bucolic Huckelberry Finn childhood at his family farm until he was diagnosed with Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease at age ten. He spent over a year in hospital and was told he would never walk again. When it was proven otherwise, he ran away to London at fourteen and joined the burgeoning Punk/New Romantic subculture. He appeared in three Gilbert and George's paintings.

In 1987, David met his partner and they moved to Barcelona the following year. He took a course in gold-leafing at the Escola Drassanes and started painting in earnest. After a few exhibitions, they travelled to live in China, Tibet and Hong Kong for three years; back to London and then again to Barcelona - painting only sporadically. They moved back to London permanently in 2000.

David got married in 2009. After a bout of illness a couple of years later, he rekindled his passion in painting and worked everyday until his demise. The bulk of his works featured in this website belongs to this period.
