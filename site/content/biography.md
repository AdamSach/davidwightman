David Majury Wightman (1963-2019) was born in Newtownards, Northern Ireland. He had a bucolic Huckelberry Finn childhood at his family farm until he was diagnosed with Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease at age ten. He spent over a year in hospital and was told he would never walk un-aided again. When it was proven otherwise, he ran away to London at fourteen and joined the burgeoning Punk/New Romantic subculture. He appeared in three Gilbert and George's paintings.

In 1987, David met his partner and they moved to Barcelona the following year. Having taken a course in gold-leafing at the Escola Drassanes, he started painting in earnest - taking part in a number of group-shows and solo exhibitions. In 1992, they travelled to live in China, Tibet and Hong Kong for three years, then back to London and again to Barcelona - painting only sporadically. They returned to London permanently in 2000.

David got married in 2009. After recovering from a bout of illness a few years later, he rekindled his passion and painted everyday until his demise, producing more than two hundred oil paintings. The bulk of the works featured on this website dates from this period.
